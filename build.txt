I first run into the 'inconvenienve' of needing to run the providers client-side. This obviously won't have been an issue for experienced next devs, but coming from the file defined ssr system of sveltekit to needing to specify "use client," made me rethink the code organization such as separating the layout into a different tsx file and structuring my header, main and footer style around that. The highlight was how I was able to debug my prompting GPT on the fact it was a rendering issue caused by the providers in the first place. #"TypeError: (0 , {imported module [project]/nodemodules/next/dist/server/route-modules/app-page/vendored/rsc/react.js [app-rsc] (ecmascript)}.createContext) is not a function" is just not  very readable
